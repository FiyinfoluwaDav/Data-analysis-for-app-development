Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets


Overview
This project focuses on identifying mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. As a data analyst, my goal is to analyze data and provide insights on which types of apps are likely to attract more users and generate revenue through in-app advertisements.

Project Objective
I aim to analyze data to understand which app categories and profiles are most successful in terms of user engagement. Since I focus on developing free apps with revenue generated from in-app ads, the primary factor influencing revenue is the number of users. This analysis will help identify the kinds of apps that are most likely to gain user traction.
